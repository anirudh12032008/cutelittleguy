# Cute little Guy
A Slack bot that spams a user with cute messages.

## Usage
 `/cutemsg @user count [msg1, msg2, ....]` 

## Example
 `/cutemsg @abc 5 ["You're awesome!" "Have a bad day!" "Keep drowning!"]`

## BONUS
try sending a message with 10+ count you will love it!!

## Note
- the bot will log who used the command on who and how many messages were sent in #cutelittleguy channel
- there will be a 3 second delay between each message to avoid rate limiting
- if rate limited I can't do anything just wait and cry :pf:
